# Python Machine Learning FAQ

It is always a pleasure to engage in discussions all around machine learning and I am happy to answer any questions regarding this book.

I just thought that it might be worthwhile to compile some documents about
the most commonly asked questions to answer them more thoroughly.

Just drop me your question, feedback, or suggestion via your medium of choice and it will be answered :)
