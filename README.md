# python-machine-learning-book

*Python Machine Learning* code repository.

What you can expect are 400 pages rich in useful material just about everything you need to know to get started with machine learning ... from theory to the actual code that you can directly put into action! This is not yet just another "this is how scikit-learn works" book. I aim to explain all the underlying concepts, tell you everything you need to know in terms of best practices and caveats, and
we will put those concepts into action mainly using NumPy, scikit-learn, and Theano.

You are not sure if this book is for you? Please checkout the excerpts from the [Foreword](./docs/foreword_ro.pdf) and [Preface](./docs/preface_sr.pdf), or take a look at the [FAQ](#faq) section for further information.

> *Sebastian Raschka’s new book, Python Machine Learning, has just been released. I got a chance to read a review copy and it’s just as I expected - really great! It’s well organized, super easy to follow, and it not only offers a good foundation for smart, non-experts, practitioners will get some ideas and learn new tricks here as well.*  
– Lon Riesberg at [Data Elixir](http://dataelixir.com/issues/55#start)

> *Superb job! Thus far, for me it seems to have hit the right balance of theory and practice…math and code!*   
– [Brian Thomas](http://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2015/writing-pymle.html#comment-2295668894)

> *I've read (virtually) every Machine Learning title based around Scikit-learn and this is hands-down the best one out there.*

<hr>

**Note**

I have set up a separate library, [`mlxtend`](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/), containing additional implementations of machine learning (and general "data science") algorithms. I also added implementations from this book (for example, the decision region plot, the artificial neural network, and sequential feature selection algorithms) with additional functionality.

***Dear readers***,  
first of all, I want to thank all of you for the great support! I am really happy about all the great feedback you sent me so far, and I am glad that the book has been so useful to a broad audience.

Over the last couple of months, I received hundreds of emails, and I tried to answer as many as possible in the available time I have. To make them useful to other readers as well, I collected many of my answers in the FAQ section (below).

In addition, some of you asked me about a platform for readers to discuss the contents of the book. I hope that this would provide an opportunity for you to discuss and share your knowledge with other readers:

#### [Google Groups Discussion Board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-machine-learning-reader-discussion-board)

(And I will try my best to answer questions myself if time allows! :))
