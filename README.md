#### IMPORTANT NOTE (09/21/2017):

This GitHub repository contains the code examples of the **1st Edition** of Python Machine Learning book. If you are looking for the code examples of the **2nd Edition**, please refer to [this](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition#whats-new-in-the-second-edition-from-the-first-edition) repository instead. 

---

What you can expect are 400 pages rich in useful material just about everything you need to know to get started with machine learning ... from theory to the actual code that you can directly put into action! This is not yet just another "this is how scikit-learn works" book. I aim to explain all the underlying concepts, tell you everything you need to know in terms of best practices and caveats, and
we will put those concepts into action mainly using NumPy, scikit-learn, and Theano.

You are not sure if this book is for you? Please checkout the excerpts from the [Foreword](./docs/foreword_ro.pdf) and [Preface](./docs/preface_sr.pdf), or take a look at the [FAQ](#faq) section for further information.

#### Additional Math and NumPy Resources

Some readers were asking about Math and NumPy primers, since they were not included due to length limitations. However, I recently put together such resources for another book, but I made these *chapters* freely available online in hope that they also serve as helpful background material for this book:

> *Sebastian Raschka’s new book, Python Machine Learning, has just been released. I got a chance to read a review copy and it’s just as I expected - really great! It’s well organized, super easy to follow, and it not only offers a good foundation for smart, non-experts, practitioners will get some ideas and learn new tricks here as well.*  
– Lon Riesberg at [Data Elixir](http://dataelixir.com/issues/55#start)

> *Superb job! Thus far, for me it seems to have hit the right balance of theory and practice…math and code!*   
– [Brian Thomas](http://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2015/writing-pymle.html#comment-2295668894)

> *I've read (virtually) every Machine Learning title based around Scikit-learn and this is hands-down the best one out there.*    
– [Jason Wolosonovich](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-machine-learning-sebastian-raschka-review-jason-wolosonovich?trk=prof-post)

> *The best book I've seen to come out of PACKT Publishing. This is a very well written introduction to machine learning with Python. As others have noted, a perfect mixture of theory and application.*    
– [Josh D.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27WB1GWTNGIR2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783555130)

> *A book with a blend of qualities that is hard to come by: combines the needed mathematics to control the theory with the applied coding in Python. Also great to see it doesn't waste paper in giving a primer on Python as many other books do just to appeal to the greater audience. You can tell it's been written by knowledgeable writers and not just DIY geeks.*    
– [Amazon Customer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZWY4TF66Z6V0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783555130)

> *Sebastian Raschka created an amazing machine learning tutorial which combines theory with practice. The book explains machine learning from a theoretical perspective and has tons of coded examples to show how you would actually use the machine learning technique. It can be read by a beginner or advanced programmer.*

#### SciPy 2016

We had such a great time at [SciPy 2016](http://scipy2016.scipy.org/ehome/index.php?eventid=146062&tabid=332930&) in Austin! It was a real pleasure to meet and chat with so many readers of my book. Thanks so much for all the nice words and feedback! And in case you missed it, Andreas Mueller and I gave an **Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn**; if you are interested, the video recordings of [Part I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB1reY6IX-o&index=91&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6) and [Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cte8FYCpylk&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6&index=90) are now online!

#### PyData Chicago 2016

I attempted the rather challenging task of introducing scikit-learn & machine learning in *just* 90 minutes at PyData Chicago 2016. The slides and tutorial material are available at "[Learning scikit-learn -- An Introduction to Machine Learning in Python](https://github.com/rasbt/pydata-chicago2016-ml-tutorial)."

**Note**

I have set up a separate library, [`mlxtend`](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/), containing additional implementations of machine learning (and general "data science") algorithms. I also added implementations from this book (for example, the decision region plot, the artificial neural network, and sequential feature selection algorithms) with additional functionality.

***Dear readers***,  
first of all, I want to thank all of you for the great support! I am really happy about all the great feedback you sent me so far, and I am glad that the book has been so useful to a broad audience.

Over the last couple of months, I received hundreds of emails, and I tried to answer as many as possible in the available time I have. To make them useful to other readers as well, I collected many of my answers in the FAQ section (below).

In addition, some of you asked me about a platform for readers to discuss the contents of the book. I hope that this would provide an opportunity for you to discuss and share your knowledge with other readers:

#### [Google Groups Discussion Board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-machine-learning-reader-discussion-board)

(And I will try my best to answer questions myself if time allows! :))

## Examples and Applications by Readers

Once again, I have to say (big!) THANKS for all the nice feedback about the book. I've received many emails from readers, who
put the concepts and examples from this book out into the real world and make good use of them in their projects. In this section, I am
starting to gather some of these great applications, and I'd be more than happy to add your project to this list -- just shoot me a quick mail!

I am happy to answer questions! Just write me an [email](mailto:mail@sebastianraschka.com)
or consider asking the question on the [Google Groups Email List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-machine-learning-book).

If you are interested in keeping in touch, I have quite a lively twitter stream ([@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt)) all about data science and machine learning. I also maintain a [blog](http://sebastianraschka.com/articles.html) where I post all of the things I am particularly excited about.
